# Checker Framework for VS Code

This project is an extension for VS Code to provide the features of the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/),
via the [Checker Framework Language Server](https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-languageserver).


## Getting Started

You can either install the extension from the
[VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
or install a locally-built version of the extension.
Please refer to the "Developer's Guide" below for instructions on how to build from source.

After installing the extension, when you open or save any `.java` file it will be checked
by the Checker Framework [Nullness Checker](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#nullness-checker).
Other type systems and options can be enabled in the configuration.

The first time the extension is run, two dependencies will be downloaded: the latest version of the
Checker Framework ([eisop/checker-framework](https://github.com/eisop/checker-framework))
and the [Checker Framework Language Server](https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-languageserver).

### Prerequisites

A JDK is required, i.e. `JAVA_HOME` needs to be properly set. JDK versions 8, 9, and 11 are supported. Node.js and npm are also required.

## Build from source
### Environment setup:
1. Install the newest Node.js version for your operating system (OS); see the [Node.Js homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install a Git client for your OS; see the [Git homepage](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Create a working directory for the project and go into it.
4. Clone the project in the new directory `git clone https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-vscode.git`
5. Change into the cloned directory `cd checker-framework-vscode`.
6. Install dependencies using `npm install`, as superuser. (Use `Open command prompt (CMD) (admin)` on Windows.) See the [npm Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install).

### Install extension:
1. Run `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`, as superuser.
2. Run `npm add -g @vscode/vsce`.
3. In the `checker-framework-vscode` directory, run `vsce package` to generate a `.vsix` file 
4. Run `code --install-extension checker-framework-language-server-0.2.0.vsix` 

## Developer's Guide
### Test local downloader: 
1. Change back into your project working directory. 
2. Clone the downloader in the project directory `git clone https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-languageserver-downloader.git`
3. Change into the downloader folder and run `./gradlew assemble`.
   See file `[README.md](https://github.com/eisopux/checker-framework-languageserver-downloader/blob/master/README.md)` for more details.
4. Copy `build/libs/checker-framework-languageserver-downloader-all.jar` to the pluginâ€™s folder and rename it to replace the file `checker-framework-languageserver-downloader.jar`

### Test local language server or checkerframework:
After successfully build from source, change the path in `.vscode/setting.json` like the following code. 
```{
    "checker-framework.frameworkPath": "/path/to/custom/framework",
    "checker-framework.languageServerPath": "/path/to/custom/languageserver.jar"
}
```

save the file and restart Visual Studio code.

### Trouble shooting:
Use the Toggle Developer Tools to get log information in command Palette in Visual Studio Code.

Under `View -> Extensions` in VS Code check that the 'checker-framework-language-server' is installed. 
During development, you can simply start the program from the command line and run as a new VS Code instance:
1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Open up this project (`checker-framework-vscode`) in VS Code and start a new instance by clicking on `Run`
    in the menu bar, then `Start Debugging`. 
3. Open a `.java` file (this can be a simple Hello World example) in the `[Extension Development Host]` instance of VSCode.

### Configuration

The following configuration parameters are available:

#### `checkers`

The list of checkers that are used to check source files. Shorthand names and full names are
both supported.
The list of all checkers can be found in the [Checker Framework manual](https://checkerframework.org/manual).

```
"checker-framework.checkers": [
    "interning",
    "org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker"
]
```

#### `commandLineOptions`

The list of command-line options that are passed to the Checker Framework. This can include options to javac.
See the list of standard [Checker Framework options](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#checker-options). In 
addition, a list of options that can change the behaviors of this plugin is included in 
[LSP-related Command-Line Options](#lsp-related-command-line-options).

Sample setting:

```
"checker-framework.commandLineOptions": [
    "-proc:only"
]
```

#### `frameworkPath`

The path to the root folder of the Checker Framework to use.
The directory should follow the layout of an unzipped Checker Framework release zip file. 
By default, this extension will set this up for you.

Sample setting:

```
"checker-framework.frameworkPath": "/Users/joe/env/checker-framework-3.0.0"
```

#### `languageServerPath`

The path of the jar file of the Checker Frameowrk Language Server. This will usually be set up automatically.

Sample setting:

```
"checker-framework.languageServerPath": "/Users/bob/env/checker-framework-languageserver-all.jar"
```

#### `checkerframework_org`

This specifies from which Github organization to download the Checker Framework release.
The default is `eisop`.

Sample setting:

```
"checker-framework.checkerframework_org": "eisop"
```

#### `checkerframework_repo`

This specifies from which Github repository under `checkerframework_org` to download the Checker Framework.
The default is `checker-framework`.

Combined with `checkerframework_org`, the default Checker Framework is `eisop/checker-framework`.

Sample setting:

```
"checker-framework.checkerframework_repo": "checker-framework"
```

#### `languageserver_org`

This specifies from which Github organization to download the Checker Framework Language Server.
The default is `eisopux`.

Sample setting:

```
"checker-framework.languageserver_org": "eisopux"
```

#### `languageserver_repo`

This specifies from which Github repository under `languageserver_org` to download the Checker Framework Language Server.
The default is `checker-framework-languageserver`.

Combined with `languageserver_org`, the default language server is `eisopux/checker-framework-languageserver`.

Sample setting:

```
"checker-framework.languageserver_repo": "checker-framework-languageserver"
```


## LSP-related Command-Line Options

This section provides a list of the Checker Framework command-line options that are related to the features of this LSP 
plugin. You can turn on/off an option by adding/removing the corresponding flag in 
[`commandLineOptions`](#commandlineoptions).

- `-AlspTypeInfo`: Once enabled, the plugin will display a pop-up showing the related type information when hovering on 
some meaningful syntax in the source file. This option is enabled by default.
